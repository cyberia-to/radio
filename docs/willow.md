# willow

confidential sync protocol for private data sharing between peers

implementation of the Willow protocol (willowprotocol.org) with Meadowcap as the companion capability-based access control system

## key property

encrypted reconciliation — peers can sync data without revealing what they have to unauthorized parties. the protocol leaks no information about entries beyond what the peer is authorized to see

## architecture

engine (core sync loop), form (data structures), interest (subscription model), session (peer sync sessions), store (persistence layer), proto (wire protocol implementation)

## capability certificates

Meadowcap defines who can read and write what. capabilities are delegatable — a holder can create restricted sub-capabilities with narrower scope. certificates chain from the namespace authority down to individual peers

## role in cyber

willow enables private [[cybergraph]] partitions. [[neurons]] that need confidential collaboration — private research, restricted data, personal knowledge — sync via willow without exposing content to the broader network. complements the public [[cybergraph]] with private overlays where access is controlled by capability certificates rather than public broadcast
